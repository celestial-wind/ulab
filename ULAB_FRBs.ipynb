    "### Astronomy: gravitation and electromagnetism\n",
    "\n",
    "In this quick introduction to astronomical research it would be good to cover the basic physics before moving into the particulars of radio astronomy and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Often in physics the universe is portrayed as a soup of quantum particles that do strange quantum things and somehow build up into what is observed in nature. This is typically called *reductionism* in the philosophical parlance. However, there are alternative views like *emergence* where lots of smaller things can become other bigger things with there own behaviors and laws. In classical physics the \"three-body problem\" makes analytical (pen and paper) solutions mostly impossible for any system with 3+ bodies, like the Sun, Earth and moon. Whereas in quantum mechanics and relativity calculating systems with more than 2 particles results in a similar impasse. Usually the way around this is going to numerical solutions and methods, which basically means using the computer to do the calculations!\n",
    "\n",
    "For astronomers—with the exception for stellar fusion, quantum line emissions, and a few high-energy processes like the big bang—the majority of the physics is gravitation and electromagnetism (plus the majority of the emission spectra is typically found experimentally not theoretically, with the major exception being 21cm neutral hydrogen, which you will encounter if you take quantum physics!). These two areas of physics have a lot in common, e.g., in CGS units astronomers tend to use\n",

    "where the \"charge\" ($q_i$ for electromagnetism) of gravity is typically mass, $m_i$, but could be energy $E = \\gamma m c^2$, and $r$ is the radial distance between the charges; although they are typically compared by strength: the ratio of the gravitational to electromagnetic force **for particles** is on the order of $\\sim 10^{42}$, with gravity being the lesser. For astronomical bodies, however, gravitation is often playing the larger role. Magnetic fields, which are harder to observe than massive (hot) things, are often neglected (especially in undergraduate classes). Radio astronomy is probably the best tool for visualizing magnetic fields outside of the solar system for a variety of reasons—but mostly because of the way electromagnetic (radio) waves propagate through regions with magnetic fields (spectral line splitting, i.e., the Zeeman effect, and a few other techniques like polarization can be used in certain cases at other wavebands).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have completed the $5/7$ series or equivalent you probably have seen Maxwell's equations. These come up in an area of astronomy called magnetohydrodynamics where they are combined with the equations of fluids, which typically includes gravity, to produce a system of equations that can be used to model plasma and other astrophysical objects like accretion disks. This is a very involved field—but is much easier than trying to solve Schrodinger's equation for zillions of particles—so the important results and tools like dispersion relations will be covered below without any derivations, just hand wavy arguments and pictures (observational astronomers, like Faraday, typically think about magnetic fields as *lines of force* anyways). The prototypical image of dispersion is the prism"

Thunderstorms are very bright sources of radio waves and actually power a resonance in the Earth's atmosphere that pulsates at around $7$ Hz; the FRBs are much more energetic and are typically oscillating around $1$ GHz (for comparison, Wi-Fi and microwave ovens operate around $2.4/5$ GHz).\n",

    "The most important physics for FRBs and radio astronomy, at the basic level, will be the concepts of luminosity and flux density. Luminosity, $L$, is basically a pseudonym for power or $E/t$ (energy/time). For a black body (an object in thermal equilibrium, i.e., roughly the same temperature as its surroundings) the luminosity is given by the Steffan-Boltzmann equation\n",

This allows radio astronomers to get an approximate temperature for objects based on the flux recived, *if the object is in thermodynamic equilibrium*.

For optical observations this generally means spectral lines; for x-ray and $\\gamma-ray$ there are high-energy events like supernovae that are not thermalized; and for radio there are free-free radiation and synchrontron radiation that actually get more intense as frequency goes down!
